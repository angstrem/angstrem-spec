Experimental, for-fun multiparadigm language.

**idea**:

The idea is to create very dynamic language built on robust phylosophy
and experience of some other dynamic languages (mostly JavaScript).

Most noteable points:
* Dynamic strong typisation.
* Mixins instead of single prototype.
* Protocols instead of magic methods.
* No special `this` variable, partially binded functions instead.
* Controlled closures.
* Filter-map-reduce.
* Asynchronous things looks like synchronous.
* Streaming, stream transformations, lazy evaluating.
* Non-obligatory interpreter type/perfomance hints.
* Symbols.
